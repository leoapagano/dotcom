- Overhauled backend systems for a Python-based educational game used by 600+ students in a university-level engineering course, enhancing student engagement and learning outcomes.
- Designed and implemented a player data collection and export system, collecting valuable game interactions data with A/B testing for an ongoing research project, ensuring reliable data flow and integrity.
- Built and maintained GitHub Actions pipelines for automating packaging and deployment of the game's macOS and Linux distributions, streamlining the release process for multiple platforms and reducing manual effort.
- Collaborated with other development teams (e.g., artwork, audio, educators, research) to ensure technical aspects of the game aligned with educational objectives, resulting in a more impactful learning tool.
